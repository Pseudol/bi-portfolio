Consumer Financial Complaints Analytics Challenge
Stepping into the role of a data analyst at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a U.S. government agency ensuring fairness and accountability in the financial sector.
The CFPB collects complaints from consumers across the United States regarding financial products and services. Each complaint is tracked from submission through company response.
You’ve been provided with a dataset of consumer complaints spanning multiple financial categories, locations, and companies.
